# web-copilot-demo

This is a simple web app built using github copilot

## Instructions

### Before the demo

1. Create a react project in any way you like:

```sh
npm create vite@latest web-copilot-demo --template react
cd web-copilot-demo
npm install
npm run dev
```

1. Clean up `src/App.jsx` and `src/App.css` to simplify them for the demo.
1. Make sure you have Github Copilot installed as an extension and you have signed in.

Now you should be set!

### Create a button

1. Create a new empty file in `src/Button.jsx`.
1. Add this comment:  `// Write a button component` but don't press return yet.
1. Copilot will make a suggestion. Point this out to the students. 
1. Press `tab` to accept the suggestion,  and edit it if needed: ```// Write a button component with the label "Click me!".```
1. Press return. Copilot will start a new comment and suggest what to do when clicked.
1. Edit the line to say a click should trigger an alert.
1. Press return twice and Copilot will begin suggesting code.
1. Use tab to accept suggestions. Press return twice and wait a moment if Copilot isn't making suggestions. 
1. Once you have the button, add it to `App.jsx`.
1. Run the demo (for example: `npm run dev`)
