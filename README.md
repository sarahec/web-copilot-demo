# web-copilot-demo

This is a simple web app built using github copilot

## Instructions

### Before the demo

1. Create a react project in any way you like:

```sh
npm create vite@latest web-copilot-demo --template react
cd web-copilot-demo
npm install
npm run dev
```

1. Clean up `src/App.jsx` and `src/App.css` to simplify them for the demo.
1. Make sure you have Github Copilot installed as an extension and you have signed in.

Now you should be set!
